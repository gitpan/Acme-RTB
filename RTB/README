Acme/RTB version 0.01
=====================

RealTimeBattle is a programming game for Unix, in which robots controlled by programs are fighting each other. The goal is to destroy the enemies, using the radar to examine the environment and the cannon to shoot.

Even though the environment the robots are moving in is fairly simple, it is far from easy to construct an intelligent robot-program. RealTimeBattle is constructed to be easy to use, flexible and fast. The intention is that the program could be used as a test for intelligent algorithms, as well as just a game to play and enjoy.
